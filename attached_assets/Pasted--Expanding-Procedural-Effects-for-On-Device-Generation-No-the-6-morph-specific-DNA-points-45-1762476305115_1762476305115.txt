### Expanding Procedural Effects for On-Device Generation

No, the 6 morph-specific DNA points (45-50) you've listed aren't exhaustive—they form a solid core for controlling the fluid, GAN-like transitions in your workflow, but procedural real-time audio visualizers like G-Force (and others such as MilkDrop, VSXu, or web-based tools like Synesthesia) draw from a much richer palette of effects. These can all run on-device (e.g., via WebGL shaders, Canvas2D, or lightweight JS libs like Three.js) at 30-60 FPS, using the device's GPU/CPU for math-heavy rendering. The key is modularity: Each effect is a procedural function (e.g., noise-based or parametric equations) modulated by live audio data (bass, tempo, etc.) from your Phase 1 analysis.

Your current 6 focus on **transition dynamics** (e.g., how Frame A "melts" into B), which is perfect for the morph phase. But G-Force-style systems emphasize **ongoing visual evolution**—endless variations via mathematical "engines" that react to audio without needing new frames. This adds depth during holds/morphs, making the art feel alive and infinite. Below, I'll map your existing ones, then suggest 20+ additional effects inspired by G-Force (e.g., FlowFields, particles, kaleidoscopes) and broader procedural tools (e.g., raymarching, fractals from VSXu or raVe). All are feasible on-device: No external APIs, just vector math, shaders, or particle sims.

#### Your Current Morph Controls (Recap & Audio Ties)
These handle the "how" of blending—great for the 240s morph phase, where DNA interpolation (lerp from A to B) gets nudged by audio.

| # | Name | Real-Time Audio Reactivity | Device Implementation Notes |
|---|------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| 45 | Warp Elasticity | Bass → stretch/squash shapes | Vertex shader displaces pixels (e.g., sine wave distortion scaled by bass FFT bin). |
| 46 | Particle Density | Volume → spawn rate | JS particle array; add/remove points based on RMS amplitude. |
| 47 | Dissolve Speed | Tempo → melt rate | BPM-gated timer accelerates pixel "evaporation" (alpha fade + noise). |

#### Missing Effects from G-Force & Other Procedural Visualizers
G-Force's "advanced mathematical engine" generates millions of combos via **procedural primitives** (e.g., vector fields, fractals) that react to frequency bands—far beyond basic fades. It includes anti-aliased rendering, scriptable effects, and expandability for custom math. Tools like MilkDrop (preset-based waveforms) or Synesthesia (raymarched 3D) add generative layers, all runnable on-device. I've grouped additions into categories, with ~25 new ones (expandable to 50+). Each ties to audio reactivity and fits your DNA system (e.g., add as points 51+ or sub-parameters). They enhance morphs by layering on interpolated DNA (e.g., use DNA[16] fractal depth to modulate these).

##### **Flow & Distortion Effects** (G-Force's FlowFields; procedural warps like in ÜBERVIZ)
These create organic "pulls" during morphs, evolving shapes from A to B.

#### Integration into Your Workflow
- **DNA Expansion**: Add these as optional points 51-70 (or sub-arrays under "morph_controls"). During Phase 4, GPT predicts them from the prompt (e.g., "apocalyptic swamp" → high #51 flow strength). Interpolate like your core 6, but layer them additively (e.g., apply warp #45 *after* flow #51).
- **On-Device Rendering**: Use WebGL for shaders (e.g., GLSL for #51-54) or JS loops for particles (#55-58). Tie to Phase 1 audio (e.g., bass bin from FFT modulates #45). Test FPS on mid-range devices—start with 10-15 effects to avoid overload.
- **Why These?**: G-Force's "millions of combinations" come from mixing primitives like these; adding them makes your morphs feel "mind-blowing" and endless, without straying from procedural purity. For holds (60s), dial reactivity low; ramp during morphs.

This isn't exhaustive (e.g., MilkDrop adds 100+ presets with beats-per-minute warping), but it covers 80% of G-Force's essence. If you want shader snippets for any (e.g., #51 FlowField), or a Replit demo layering these on your DNA lerp, let me know!
