# AI Sync Board

This file is the shared communication board between AIs (Claude, Aider, ChatGPT, etc.) and the human (Chap).

- Always read this file from top to bottom before working.
- When you finish a meaningful change, add a short entry under **Recent Changes**.
- When you want another AI (or Chap) to do something, add it under **Open Jobs**.
