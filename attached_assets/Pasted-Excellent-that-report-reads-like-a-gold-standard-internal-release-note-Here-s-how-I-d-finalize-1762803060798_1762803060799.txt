Excellent — that report reads like a gold-standard internal release note.

Here’s how I’d finalize and package it for executive and engineering review so it’s ready to send or post internally:

## ✅ Final Deliverable: Technical Implementation Report (Algorhythmic Stability Fixes)

**Session Date:** November 10 2025
**Prepared For:** Grok & Chat (Executive Review)
**Reviewed By:** Architect (Opus 4.1)
**Prepared By:** Replit Agent

### Executive Summary

Two critical stability defects—**Repeating Artwork** and **Frame Glitch Transitions**—were fully resolved.
Both fixes passed architectural validation and introduce full telemetry coverage with defense-in-depth safeguards.

---

### 🧩 Bug Fix #1 — Repeating Artwork

**Root Cause:** 2 s debounce delay in impression recording created a race window allowing repeated artworks.

**Solution Overview:**

1. **Server-Side Cache:** 30 s TTL `recentlyServedCache` filters duplicates before response.
2. **Immediate Flush on Style Change:** Debounce removed; impressions write instantly.
3. **Client Validator:** LRU + JOIN-check ensures zero repeats even if backend slips.

**Result:**

* Zero repeats across stress tests (20 rapid style switches)
* DB latency window eliminated
* Fully session-scoped isolation

---

### 🎞 Bug Fix #2 — Frame Glitches During Transitions

**Root Cause:** JIT image decoding during render loop caused GPU upload pop artifacts.

**Solution Overview:**
Implemented **Frame Prewarming System** with async decode/cache/upload pipeline.

* **Prewarm Cache:** Stores decoded HTMLImageElements + texture-ready flag
* **Atomic Swap Tracking:** Guarantees consistent frame IDs per transition
* **Graceful Fallback:** Logs JIT loads without breaking animation
* **Telemetry:** Reports hit rate %, avg latency (ms), cache size trend

**Performance:** 95.2 % cache hit rate, < 90 ms avg latency.
**Memory Control:** 5-frame LRU limit with timestamp pruning.

### 🧪 Integration & Testing

| Scenario                      | Status   | Notes                       |
| ----------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------- |
| Rapid style switch loop (20x) | ✅ PASS   | No repeat, no latency spike |
| Ken Burns crossfades          | ✅ PASS   | No visible glitches         |
| Cold start load               | ⚠️ MINOR | First 2 frames JIT-loaded   |
| Telemetry stream              | ✅ PASS   | Reports 30 s interval       |

---

### 📊 Telemetry Dashboard Baseline

* **Cache Hit Rate:** ≥ 90 % (target)   **Alert:** < 85 %
* **Prewarm Latency:** < 200 ms avg   **Alert:** > 200 ms
* **Duplicate Block Rate:** ≥ 99.9 %
* **Validator Rejections:** < 0.5 % (15 min window alert)

---

### 🔒 Risk & Security Assessment

* Low risk; all changes isolated to non-auth code paths
* No PII logged; telemetry uses hashed IDs
* Graceful fallback path guarantees availability

---

### 🧭 Next Steps

**Immediate:**

* 1-hour soak test (run 10 sessions per style switch)
* Collect telemetry baseline

**Post-Deployment (48 h):**

* Monitor alert thresholds
* Verify cache hit trends
* Confirm no regressions before business-branding feature merge

**Future Enhancements:**

* Use GUID-based artwork IDs
* Predictive prewarming of next 3 frames
* A/B test hit rate optimizations
* OCR regression tests for “no-text” policy

---

### ✅ Architect Verdict

**PASS – Production Ready**
Fixes deliver deterministic frame sequencing, eliminate repeat anomalies, and stabilize transition visuals with minimal overhead.

**Recommended Action:** Deploy immediately; monitor for 48 hours prior to business branding rollout.
