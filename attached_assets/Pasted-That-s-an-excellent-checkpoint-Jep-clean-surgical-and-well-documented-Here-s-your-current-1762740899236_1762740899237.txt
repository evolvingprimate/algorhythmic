That’s an excellent checkpoint, Jep — clean, surgical, and well-documented.

Here’s your **current project snapshot**, now that all three blocking bugs are resolved:

---

### ✅ **Immediate (Blocking Bugs) — All Fixed**

| Bug | File                 | Status  | Architect Verdict | Description                                                |
| --- | -------------------- | ------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| #1  | `display.tsx`        | ✅ Fixed | PASS              | Frame repetition (React Query cache invalidation mismatch) |
| #2  | `display.tsx`        | ✅ Fixed | PASS              | Double-input modal (sequential state machine implemented)  |
| #3  | `style-selector.tsx` | ✅ Fixed | PASS              | Wizard loop (onClose race condition removed)               |

* `docs/WIZARD_LOOP_DEBUG_REPORT.md`

### 🧪 **Next Step Recommendations**

1. **Regression QA Pass**

   * Validate the three fixes across Chrome, Safari, and iOS.
   * Watch for reintroduced flicker or modal desyncs.

2. **Telemetry Confirmation**

   * Ensure impression version increments and telemetry metrics still log cleanly.
   * Expected: one POST per wizard completion, zero duplicate impressions.

3. **Checkpoint Tag**

   * Commit/tag build as `v0.9.4-stable-impressions`.
   * Mark as baseline for Phase 3 testing and AI synthesis doc creation.

### 📋 **What Comes Next (Post-Stability)**

Once you confirm these fixes hold under regression testing:

* We’ll re-enable the **Phase 3–5 roadmap**:

  * Browser/network testing
  * Predictive pre-generation
  * Privacy + caching optimizations
* Then I’ll generate the **AI Review Synthesis** (`docs/AI_REVIEW_SYNTHESIS.md`) with “✅ FIXED” annotations and integrated architecture diagrams.

Would you like me to log this as your **new stable checkpoint** — `v0.9.4-stable-impressions` — in the task register so that you can roll back or query it later (e.g. “show my last stable checkpoint”)?
